# Flux — The AI-Native Project & ITSM Platform
**Last Updated:** 23:54:45 Dec 06, 2025  
**Classification:** Product Overview & Market Position

Flux is an AI-native project management and ITSM platform built to give teams time back. Every interaction flows through Gemini-powered intelligence that plans, triages, analyzes, and reports so humans can focus on the work that matters.

---

## What Flux Delivers
- **AI Architect:** Turn plain-language briefs into prioritized, estimated tasks in seconds.  
- **Workflow AI:** Analyze any workflow for bottlenecks and automation opportunities.  
- **Incident Triage & SLA Prediction:** Auto-severity, auto-assignment, and breach prediction before humans notice.  
- **Boards & Sprints:** Kanban, backlog grooming, sprint planning, velocity tracking.  
- **ITSM Console:** Incident, service catalog, change management, SLA tracking.  
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Real-time dashboards and one-click executive summaries.  
- **AI Command Terminal:** Ask for anything (“create a high-priority task”, “show tasks in review”, “switch to dark mode”) and Flux executes.

---

## Who Uses Flux
- **Software Engineering:** Reduce context switching; auto-sync PRs, issues, and sprint updates.  
- **IT Operations:** Faster MTTR with AI triage, risk-aware change management, and SLA compliance tracking.  
- **Marketing & Creative:** Campaign-ready boards, AI task breakdowns, client-facing analytics.

## Why It Matters
Flux isn’t retrofitted with AI—it’s built around it. Teams report double-digit hours saved per person each week through:
- Automated task creation and grooming  
- Instant incident triage and SLA protection  
- Self-updating boards and status reports  
- One-click imports from legacy tools

## Deployment Paths

- **Self-Hosted:** Full data sovereignty on your infra.  
- **Local Mode:** Offline-first, device-persistent.

2) Connect your existing tools in Integrations Hub.  
3) Run work from the boards, service desk, or AI command terminal.
